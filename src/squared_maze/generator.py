"""Maze generation utilities.

This module implements a randomized depth-first search (recursive backtracker)
to carve a perfect maze into a grid that includes walls as cells. The
public function `generate_maze` accepts the number of logical rows and columns
and returns a grid of size (2*rows+1) x (2*cols+1) where 1 indicates a
walkable cell and 0 indicates a wall.

The grid layout uses odd indices for rooms/cells and even indices for walls.
This makes it simple to carve passages by stepping two cells at a time and
clearing the intermediate wall.

All functions follow Google style docstrings and minimal external deps.
